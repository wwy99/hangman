# hangman
NLP tasks by Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning


Task: Build an Agent to interact with Hangman game server, guessing the correct the word less than 6 wrong guesses. 

Method: Built agent with DQN, supervised LSTM, and frequency matching algorithm. Compared performnance, fine tune and hybrid prediction. 

Result: Achieved 30% test result on un-seen words by using LSTM supervised + frequency algorithm.
